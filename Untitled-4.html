    <br><br><br><br> <p>The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology
          that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner. 
          The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been 
          broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities 
          that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The 
          traits described below have received the most attention.[15]</p>
